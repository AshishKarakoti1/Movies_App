# 🎬 Movie Recommendation App

A beginner-friendly movie discovery app built using **React** and **Vite**, integrating the **TMDB API** for real-time movie data and **Appwrite** for backend storage.  
This project was made as part of my journey to **understand React better by building something practical and fun**.

## 📚 Purpose of the Project

I created this project to:
- Practice building a React application from scratch
- Learn how to manage component state and side effects using `useState` and `useEffect`
- Understand API integrations (TMDB for data, Appwrite for backend)
- Work with debouncing, dynamic rendering, and conditional UI
- Explore modern tooling like Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel deployment

- 📈 View trending movies (stored in Appwrite)  
- 🌀 Loading spinner for better UX  
- ⚡ Debounced search input  
- 📱 Mobile-friendly, clean UI  
- 🧠 Clear component structure (Search, MovieCard, Spinner, etc.)
